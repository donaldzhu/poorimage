				<p>The poor image is a copy in motion. Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard. As it
					accelerates, it
					deteriorates. It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image
					distributed for free, squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped,
					remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution.</p>
				<p>The poor image is a rag or a rip; an AVI or a JPEG, a lumpen proletarian in the class society of
					appearances, ranked and valued according to its resolution. The poor image has been uploaded,
					downloaded, shared, reformatted, and reedited. It transforms quality into accessibility, exhibition
					value into cult value, films into clips, contemplation into distraction. The image is liberated from
					the
					vaults of cinemas and archives and thrust into digital uncertainty, at the expense of its own
					substance.
					The poor image tends towards abstraction: it is a visual idea in its very becoming.</p>
				<p>The poor image is an illicit fifth-generation bastard of an original image. Its genealogy is dubious.
					Its
					filenames are deliberately misspelled. It often defies patrimony, national culture, or indeed
					copyright.
					It is passed on as a lure, a decoy, an index, or as a reminder of its former visual self. It mocks
					the
					promises of digital technology. Not only is it often degraded to the point of being just a hurried
					blur,
					one even doubts whether it could be called an image at all. Only digital technology could produce
					such a
					dilapidated image in the first place.</p>
				<p>Poor images are the contemporary Wretched of the Screen, the debris of audiovisual production, the
					trash
					that washes up on the digital economies’ shores. They testify to the violent dislocation,
					transferrals,
					and displacement of images—their acceleration and circulation within the vicious cycles of
					audiovisual
					capitalism. Poor images are dragged around the globe as commodities or their effigies, as gifts or
					as
					bounty. They spread pleasure or death threats, conspiracy theories or bootlegs, resistance or
					stultification. Poor images show the rare, the obvious, and the unbelievable—that is, if we can
					still
					manage to decipher it.</p>

			<h1>1. LOW RESOLUTIONS</h1>
			<p><span class="inline-citation" id="span-1">In one of Woody Allen’s films </span> <sup>1</sup> the main
				character is out of focus. It’s not a technical problem but some sort of disease that has befallen
				him:
				his image is consistently blurred. Since Allen’s character is an actor, this becomes a major
				problem: he
				is
				unable to find work. His lack of definition turns into a material problem. Focus is identified as a
				class position, a position of ease and privilege, while being out of focus lowers one’s value as an
				image.</p>
			<p>The contemporary hierarchy of images, however, is not only based on sharpness, but also and primarily
				on resolution. Just look at any electronics store and this system, described by Harun Farocki in a
				notable <span class="inline-citation" id="span-2">2007 interview,</span><sup>2</sup> becomes
				immediately apparent. In the
				class society of images, cinema takes on the role of a flagship store. In flagship stores high-end
				products are marketed in an upscale environment. More affordable derivatives of the same images
				circulate as DVDs, on broadcast television or online, as poor images.
			</p>
			<p>Obviously, a high-resolution image looks more brilliant and impressive, more mimetic and magic, more
				scary and seductive than a poor one. It is more rich, so to speak. Now, even consumer formats are
				increasingly adapting to the tastes of cineastes and esthetes, who insisted on 35 mm film as a
				guarantee of pristine visuality. The insistence upon analog film as the sole medium of visual
				importance resounded throughout discourses on cinema, almost regardless of their ideological
				inflection. It never mattered that these high-end economies of film production were (and still are)
				firmly anchored in systems of national culture, capitalist studio production, the cult of mostly
				male genius, and the original version, and thus are often conservative in their very structure.
				Resolution was fetishized as if its lack amounted to castration of the author. The cult of film
				gauge dominated even independent film production. The rich image established its own set of
				hierarchies, with new technologies offering more and more possibilities to creatively degrade it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section-2" class="ui-widget-content main" style="z-index: 5">
			<h1>2. RESURRECTION <i>(AS POOR IMAGES)</i></h1>
			<p>But insisting on rich images also had more serious consequences. A speaker at a recent conference on
				the film essay refused to show clips from a piece by Humphrey Jennings because no proper film
				projection was available. Although there was at the speaker’s disposal a perfectly standard DVD
				player and video projector, the audience was left to imagine what those images might have looked
				like.</p>
			<p>In this case the invisibility of the image was more or less voluntary and based on aesthetic
				premises. But it has a much more general equivalent based on the consequences of neoliberal
				policies. Twenty or even thirty years ago, the neoliberal restructuring of media production began
				slowly obscuring non-commercial imagery, to the point where experimental and essayistic cinema
				became almost invisible. As it became prohibitively expensive to keep these works circulating in
				cinemas, so were they also deemed too marginal to be broadcast on television. Thus they slowly
				disappeared not just from cinemas, but from the public sphere as well. Video essays and experimental
				films remained for the most part unseen save for some rare screenings in metropolitan film museums
				or film clubs, projected in their original resolution before disappearing again into the darkness of
				the archive.
			</p>
			<p>This development was of course connected to the neoliberal radicalization of the concept of culture
				as commodity, to the commercialization of cinema, its dispersion into multiplexes, and the
				marginalization of independent filmmaking. It was also connected to the restructuring of global
				media industries and the establishment of monopolies over the audiovisual in certain countries or
				territories. In this way, resistant or non-conformist visual matter disappeared from the surface
				into an underground of alternative archives and collections, kept alive only by a network of
				committed organizations and individuals, who would circulate bootlegged VHS copies amongst
				themselves. Sources for these were extremely rare—tapes moved from hand to hand, depending on word
				of mouth, within circles of friends and colleagues. With the possibility to stream video online,
				this condition started to dramatically change. An increasing number of rare materials reappeared on
				publicly accessible platforms, some of them carefully curated (Ubuweb) and some just a pile of stuff
				(YouTube).
			</p>
			<p>At present, there are at least twenty torrents of Chris Marker’s film essays available online. If you
				want a retrospective, you can have it. But the economy of poor images is about more than just
				downloads: you can keep the files, watch them again, even reedit or improve them if you think it
				necessary. And the results circulate. Blurred AVI files of half-forgotten masterpieces are exchanged
				on semi-secret P2P platforms. Clandestine cell-phone videos smuggled out of museums are broadcast on
				YouTube. DVDs of artists’ viewing copies are <span class="inline-citation"
					id="span-3">bartered.</span><sup>3</sup> Many
				works of avant-garde, essayistic, and non-commercial cinema have been resurrected as poor images.
				Whether they like it or not.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section-3" class="ui-widget-content main" style="z-index: 4">
			<h1>3. PRIVATIZATION AND PRIVACY</h1>
			<p>That rare prints of militant, experimental, and classical works of cinema as well as video art
				reappear as poor images is significant on another level. Their situation reveals much more than the
				content or appearance of the images themselves: <span class="inline-citation" id="span-4">it also
					reveals the conditions of
					their marginalization, the constellation of social forces leading to their online circulation as
					poor images.</span><sup>4</sup> Poor images are poor because they are not assigned any value
				within the class society of images—their status as illicit or degraded grants them exemption from
				its criteria. Their lack of resolution attests to <span class="inline-citation" id="span-5">their
					appropriation and
					displacement.</span><sup>5</sup></p>
			<p>Obviously, this condition is not only connected to the neoliberal restructuring of media production
				and digital technology; it also has to do with the post-socialist and postcolonial restructuring of
				nation states, their cultures, and their archives. While some nation states are dismantled or fall
				apart, new cultures and traditions are invented and new histories created. This obviously also
				affects film archives—in many cases, a whole heritage of film prints is left without its supporting
				framework of national culture. <span class="inline-citation" id="span-6"> As I once observed</span>
				<sup>6</sup> in the case
				of a film museum in Sarajevo, the national archive can find its next life in the form of a
				video-rental store. Pirate copies seep out of such archives through disorganized privatization. On
				the other hand, even the British Library sells off its contents online at astronomical prices.
			</p>
			<p><span class="inline-citation" id="span-7">As Kodwo Eshun has noted,</span><sup>7</sup> poor images
				circulate partly in the
				void left by state-cinema organizations who find it too difficult to operate as a 16/35-mm archive
				or to maintain any kind of distribution infrastructure in the contemporary era. From this
				perspective, the poor image reveals the decline and degradation of the film essay, or indeed any
				experimental and non-commercial cinema, which in many places was made possible because the
				production of culture was considered a task of the state. Privatization of media production
				gradually grew more important than state controlled/sponsored media production. But, on the other
				hand, the rampant privatization of intellectual content, along with online marketing and
				commodification, also enable piracy and appropriation; it gives rise to the circulation of poor
				images.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section-4" class="ui-widget-content main" style="z-index: 3">
			<h1>4. IMPERFECT CINEMA</h1>
			<p>The emergence of poor images reminds one of a classic Third Cinema manifesto, For an <span
					class="inline-citation" id="span-8">Imperfect Cinema,</span><sup>8</sup> by Juan García
				Espinosa, written in Cuba in the
				late 1960s. Espinosa argues for an imperfect cinema because, in his words, “perfect
				cinema—technically and artistically masterful—is almost always reactionary cinema.” The imperfect
				cinema is one that strives to overcome the divisions of labor within class society. It merges art
				with life and science, blurring the distinction between consumer and producer, audience and author.
				It insists upon its own imperfection, is popular but not consumerist, committed without becoming
				bureaucratic.
			</p>
			<p>In his manifesto, Espinosa also reflects on the promises of new media. He clearly predicts that the
				development of video technology will jeopardize the elitist position of traditional filmmakers and
				enable some sort of mass film production: an art of the people. Like the economy of poor images,
				imperfect cinema diminishes the distinctions between author and audience and merges life and art.
				Most of all, its visuality is resolutely compromised: blurred, amateurish, and full of artifacts.
			</p>
			<p>In some way, the economy of poor images corresponds to the description of imperfect cinema, while the
				description of perfect cinema represents rather the concept of cinema as a flagship store. But the
				real and contemporary imperfect cinema is also much more ambivalent and affective than Espinosa had
				anticipated. On the one hand, the economy of poor images, with its immediate possibility of
				worldwide distribution and its ethics of remix and appropriation, enables the participation of a
				much larger group of producers than ever before. But this does not mean that these opportunities are
				only used for progressive ends. Hate speech, spam, and other rubbish make their way through digital
				connections as well. Digital communication has also become one of the most contested markets—a zone
				that has long been subjected to an ongoing original accumulation and to massive (and, to a certain
				extent, successful) attempts at privatization.
			</p>
			<p>The networks in which poor images circulate thus constitute both a platform for a fragile new common
				interest and a battleground for commercial and national agendas. They contain experimental and
				artistic material, but also incredible amounts of porn and paranoia. While the territory of poor
				images allows access to excluded imagery, it is also permeated by the most advanced commodification
				techniques. While it enables the users’ active participation in the creation and distribution of
				content, it also drafts them into production. Users become the editors, critics, translators, and
				(co-)authors of poor images.
			</p>
			<p>Poor images are thus popular images—images that can be made and seen by the many. They express all
				the contradictions of the contemporary crowd: <span class="inline-citation" id="span-9">its
					opportunism, narcissism, desire
					for autonomy and creation, its inability to focus or make up its mind, its constant readiness
					for transgression and simultaneous submission.</span><sup>9</sup> Altogether, poor images
				present a snapshot of the affective condition of the crowd, its neurosis, paranoia, and fear, as
				well as its craving for intensity, fun, and distraction. The condition of the images speaks not only
				of countless transfers and reformattings, but also of the countless people who cared enough about
				them to convert them over and over again, to add subtitles, reedit, or upload them.
			</p>
			<p>In this light, perhaps one has to redefine the value of the image, or, more precisely, to create a
				new perspective for it. Apart from resolution and exchange value, one might imagine another form of
				value defined by velocity, intensity, and spread. Poor images are poor because they are heavily
				compressed and travel quickly. They lose matter and gain speed. But they also express a condition of
				dematerialization, shared not only with the legacy of conceptual art but above all <span
					class="inline-citation" id="span-10">with contemporary modes of semiotic
					production.</span><sup>10</sup> Capital’s
				semiotic turn, as described by <span class="inline-citation" id="span-11">Felix
					Guattari,</span><sup>11</sup> plays in
				favor of the <span class="inline-citation" id="span-12">creation and dissemination of compressed and
					flexible data packages
					that can be integrated into ever-newer combinations and sequences.</span><sup>12</sup>
			</p>
			<p>This flattening-out of visual content—the concept-in-becoming of the images—positions them within a
				general informational turn, within economies of knowledge that tear images and their captions out of
				context into the swirl of <span class="inline-citation" id="span-13">permanent capitalist
					deterritorialization.</span><sup>13</sup> The history of conceptual art describes this
				dematerialization of the art object first as a resistant move against the fetish value of
				visibility. Then, however, the dematerialized art object turns out to be perfectly adapted to the
				semioticization of capital, and thus to the <span class="inline-citation" id="span-14">conceptual
					turn of
					capitalism.</span><sup>14</sup> In a way, the poor image is subject to a similar tension. On the
				one hand, it operates against the fetish value of high resolution. On the other hand, this is
				precisely why it also ends up being perfectly integrated into an information capitalism thriving on
				compressed attention spans, on impression rather than immersion, on intensity rather than
				contemplation, on previews rather than screenings.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section-5" class="ui-widget-content main" style="z-index: 2">
			<h1>5. COMRADE, WHAT IS YOUR VISUAL BOND TODAY?</h1>
			<p>But, simultaneously, a paradoxical reversal happens. The circulation of poor images creates a
				circuit, which fulfills the original ambitions of militant and (some) essayistic and experimental
				cinema—to create an alternative economy of images, an imperfect cinema existing inside as well as
				beyond and under commercial media streams. In the age of file-sharing, even marginalized content
				circulates again and reconnects dispersed worldwide audiences.
			</p>
			<p>The poor image thus constructs anonymous global networks just as it creates a shared history. It
				builds alliances as it travels, provokes translation or mistranslation, and creates new publics and
				debates. By losing its visual substance it recovers some of its political punch and creates a new
				aura around it. This aura is no longer based on the permanence of the “original,” but on the
				transience of the copy. It is no longer anchored within a classical public sphere mediated and
				supported by the frame of the nation state or corporation, <span class="inline-citation"
					id="span-15a">but floats on the
					surface of temporary and dubious data pools.</span> By drifting away from the vaults of cinema,
				it is propelled onto new and ephemeral screens stitched together by the desires of dispersed
				spectators.
			</p>
			<p>The circulation of poor images thus creates “visual bonds,” as <span class="inline-citation"
					id="span-15b">Dziga Vertov once
					called them.</span><sup>15</sup> This “visual bond” was, according to <span class="inline-citation"
					id="span-16">Vertov,</span><sup>16</sup> supposed to link the workers of
				the world with each
				other. He imagined a sort of communist, visual, Adamic language that could not only inform or
				entertain, but also organize its viewers. In a sense, his dream has come true, if mostly under the
				rule of a global information capitalism whose audiences are linked almost in a physical sense by
				mutual excitement, affective attunement, and anxiety.
			</p>
			<p>But there is also the circulation and production of poor images based on cell phone cameras, home
				computers, and unconventional forms of distribution. Its optical connections—collective editing,
				file sharing, or grassroots distribution circuits—reveal erratic and coincidental links between
				producers everywhere, which simultaneously constitute dispersed audiences.
			</p>
			<p>The circulation of poor images feeds into both capitalist media assembly lines and alternative
				audiovisual economies. In addition to a lot of confusion and stupefaction, it also possibly creates
				disruptive movements of thought and affect. The circulation of poor images thus initiates another
				chapter in the historical genealogy of nonconformist information circuits: Vertov’s “visual bonds,”
				the internationalist workers pedagogies that Peter Weiss described in The Aesthetics of Resistance,
				the circuits of Third Cinema and Tricontinentalism, of non-aligned filmmaking and thinking. The poor
				image—ambivalent as its status may be—thus takes its place in the genealogy of carbon-copied
				pamphlets, cine-train agit-prop films, underground video magazines and other nonconformist
				materials, which aesthetically often used poor materials. Moreover, it reactualizes many of the
				historical ideas associated with these circuits, among others Vertov’s idea of the visual bond.
			</p>
			<p>Imagine somebody from the past with a beret asking you, “Comrade, what is your visual bond today?”
			</p>
			<p>You might answer: it is this link to the present.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section-6" class="ui-widget-content main" style="z-index: 1">
			<h1>6. NOW!</h1>
			<p>The poor image embodies the afterlife of many former masterpieces of cinema and video art. <span
					class="inline-citation" id="span-17">It has been expelled from the sheltered paradise that
					cinema seems to have once
					been.</span><sup>17</sup> After being kicked out of the protected and often protectionist arena
				of national culture, discarded from commercial circulation, these works have become travelers in a
				digital no-man’s land, constantly shifting their resolution and format, speed and media, sometimes
				even losing names and credits along the way.
			</p>
			<p>Now many of these works are back—as poor images, I admit. One could of course argue that this is not
				the real thing, but then—please, anybody—show me this real thing.
			</p>
			<p>The poor image is no longer about the real thing—the originary original. Instead, it is about its own
				real conditions of existence: about swarm circulation, digital dispersion, fractured and flexible
				temporalities. It is about defiance and appropriation just as it is about conformism and
				exploitation.
			</p>
			<p>In short: it is about reality.</p>
